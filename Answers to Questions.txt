1a) What does the AR Plane Manager do?

The AR Plane Manager helps your device understand flat surfaces in the real world, like tables or floors.

1b) Why do we need it?

We need it so that we can place virtual objects on these surfaces in a way that looks real.

1c) What does it let us do?

It lets us put virtual things, like a piano or a bench, on real surfaces so they look like they are actually there.

2) What does each object demonstrate you can spawn demonstrate?

Sphere: A ball could show how gravity and movement work.
Chair: Shows how furniture can be placed in a room to see how it fits.
Avatar: A character might show how animations and interactions happen in AR.

3) Each of the objects you can spawn have several "Affordances" what do they do?

"Affordances" are things an object can do or how you can interact with it. For example: A door can open and close. A button can be pressed. A lever can be pulled. These help make AR objects feel more real and useful.
